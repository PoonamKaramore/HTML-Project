# HTML-Project

I have developed a basic HTML website that showcases the use of various essential HTML elements, including unordered lists, semantic tags, images, and external links. 
The project is structured to highlight the foundational aspects of web development, adhering to best practices in HTML coding. Furthermore, the website has been successfully deployed using GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible online.
